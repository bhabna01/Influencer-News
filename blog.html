        <h2>What is the Difference Between let,var and const?</h2>
        <p>The var is the oldest keyword to declare a variable in JavaScript.
            The scope of the var keyword is the global or function scope. It
            means variables defined outside the function can be accessed globally, and variables defined inside a
            particular function can be accessed within the function. </p>
        <p>The let keyword is an improved version of the var keyword.
            The scope of a let variable is only block scoped. It can't be accessible outside the
            particular block ({block}).</p>
        <p> The const keyword has all the properties that are the same as the let keyword,
            except the user cannot update it.When users declare a const variable, they need to initialize it, otherwise,
            it returns
            an error. The user cannot update the const variable once it is declared. </p>
