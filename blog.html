        <h2>What is the Difference Between let,var and const?</h2>
        <p>The var is the oldest keyword to declare a variable in JavaScript.
            The scope of the var keyword is the global or function scope. It
            means variables defined outside the function can be accessed globally, and variables defined inside a
            particular function can be accessed within the function. </p>
        <p>The let keyword is an improved version of the var keyword.
            The scope of a let variable is only block scoped. It can't be accessible outside the
            particular block ({block}).</p>
        <p> The const keyword has all the properties that are the same as the let keyword,
            except the user cannot update it.When users declare a const variable, they need to initialize it, otherwise,
            it returns
            an error. The user cannot update the const variable once it is declared. </p>

        <h2>What is the difference between Arrow function and Regular function?</h2>
        <p>1.An arrow function does not have it's own this keyword. Instead, this is bound to the parent this. In the
            case
            where the arrow function is executed in the global context (it has no parent function/scope), this will be
            bound to the global object (window in the browser or globalThis in node).</p>
        <p>2.The best things about an arrow function is implicit returns.Implicit returns from arrow functions becomes
            especially useful when working with array methods or callbacks.</p>
        <p>3.The third major difference between arrow functions and regular functions is that arrow functions are always
            anonymous. They cannot be named. Whereas a regular function created with the function keyword can be named
            or anonymous (function myFunc() {... } vs function() { ... }), arrow functions are always anonymous.</p>
